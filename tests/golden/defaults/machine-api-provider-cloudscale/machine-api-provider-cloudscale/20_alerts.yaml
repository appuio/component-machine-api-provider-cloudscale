              No machineset-controller target was found. This can impact machine operations such as autoscaling.

              The machineset controller is deployed by the 'machine-api-controllers-manager' container in the 'appuio-machine-api-provider-cloudscale' deployment.
              Check for the existence of the 'appuio-machine-api-controllers' deployment and check the logs of the above manager if it does not exist.
              If the deployment exists, check the deployment and replicaset status and events to check why the pod can't be created.
            summary: Expected machineset target not found. Autoscaling and other machine
              operations might be impacted.
